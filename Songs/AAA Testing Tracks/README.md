AAA Testing Tracks
==================

Step chart(s) for StepMania that are very simple and very short in order to make it easy to test that theme you're developing.

There's also a course file for testing Oni mode with said chart(s).

Its name starts with "AAA" so that it will probably show up first in alphabetical order.

Everything other than the song files
------------------------------------

All banner and background artwork was generated trivially by setting some sliders in a graphics editor and letting it run.

The step charts are so simple and uncreative as to be practically uncopyrightable.
