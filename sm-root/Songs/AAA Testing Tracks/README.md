AAA Testing Tracks
==================

Step chart(s) for StepMania that are very simple and very short in order to make it easy to test that theme you're developing.

There's also a course file for testing Oni mode with said chart(s).

The group name and course name start with "AAA" so that they will probably show up first in alphabetical order.
